# What's this?

Session register which holds the talks for JavaZone.
Contains both a public API that can be consumed by anyone, and a private API used internally to submit talks and review/select talks.

Aiming to replace [Sleepingpill](https://github.com/javaBin/sleepingPillCore)

# Setup

## Database
Moresleep needs a database to run. A docker image is provided in the docker folder ([https://github.com/javaBin/moresleep/tree/master/docker/postgres](https://github.com/javaBin/moresleep/tree/master/docker/postgres)). 

Install docker desktop and then use the build.sh script to build the image and run.sh to run the image. You will then have a postgres installation running on port 5432.
